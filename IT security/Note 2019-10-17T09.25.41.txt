**exploit**:something that takes advanage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behaviour
**zero-day**: a vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor


types of attacker and skill/danger from 1-3

* criminals/scammers 2-3
* hacktivists 2
* countries/state 100
* script kiddies 1
* competitors 1-2
* frustrated employees 3
* black hats 3


attacker has advantages

* only has to succeed once
* can choose weakest point
* can leverage zero days
* doesn't have to play by the rules

an advanced persistent threat(APT) is when an attacker stays unnoticed inside a system. This is most often done by a state or country, for surveillance purposes

lots of examples of hacks, exploits and vulnerabilities

hardware examples: arduino usb, usb wifi HID injector(also available as cable)
